    This is a prototype to test code that enables an annotation "client"
    in an HTML/PDF etc. document to connect to the appropriate sidebar which
    retrieves annotations for the document and notifies the client about them.
    </p>
    <p>
    The connection process aims to meet the following goals:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It should be possible for multiple documents to be displayed in
          a tab which have their own independent sidebars.</li>
      <li>It should be possible for multiple frames to be displayed in a tab
          which communicate with the same sidebar.</li>
      <li>If a client is configured without a <code>subFrameIdentifier</code>
          it should create and connect to its own sidebar.</li>
      <li>If a client is configured with a <code>subFrameIdentifier</code>
          it should connect to a sidebar created by a client in a parent frame.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    I'm a client in the top-level frame.
